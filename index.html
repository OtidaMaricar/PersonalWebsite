		HI THERE! <br>
	<p> This website is about the loveteam JaDine; <br>
	James Reid and Nadine Lustre. The website <br>
	tells the background, history,projects <br>
	and most captivating pictures of the two <br>
	artists. This website is also to give more <br> 
	informations of the two young actors. <br>
	<br>
	Once upon a time, I read the story <br>
	Diary ng Panget and then heared that <br>
	there will bean upcoming movie for it <br>
	and so I searched for it and that's <br>
	when my journey to this <br>
	fandom started. And so they became more <br>
	famous and I did all I can to support <br>
	them. I started to watch all their <br>
	movies, teleseryes and even commercials. <br>
	I also bought some of their collectibles. <br>
	And this, my project, to make a <br>
	website we are interested in. <br>
	<br>
	The website is a TLE project for school.<br>
	The informations are mostly from the book, <br>
	Team Real and also other sources. So credits <br>
	for the owners of the informations and <br>
	pictures. Thank you. </p>
